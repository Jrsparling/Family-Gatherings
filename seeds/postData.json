You are kind to always smile and say that you will give my latest fave a try. BUT YOU GOTTA DROP EVERYTHING AND WATCH BLUE EYE SAMURAI ON NETFLIX!! Definitely NOT for the kiddos but is a bona-fide masterpiece. Artwork, plot, characters, voice acting, action sequences! Don't walk... RUN to your favorite easy chair and settle in for the ride of your life. This is an all-in production that you will want to immediately watch again and then be all a-twitter waiting for the next season to come out.",
